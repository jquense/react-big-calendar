# How to Contribute

Big Calendar warmly welcomes your contributions. There are several ways to help out:

- Create an [issue](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar/issues) on GitHub if you have found a bug.
- Write test cases or provide examples for open bug issues. You can start by forking our [Issue Template](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-big-calendar-example-v9wdyd) in CodeSandbox.
- Write patches for open bug/feature issues.

To ensure efficiency and organization, we ask all contributors to follow a few guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: Sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com/signup/free) if you don't already have an account.
2. **Report Issues**: Before submitting a new issue, [check if the issue already exists](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar/issues)
   - Describe the issue in detail, including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
   - Include the earliest version that you know has the issue.
3. **Fork the Repository**: Make a personal fork of the repository on GitHub to start your work.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Topic Branch**: Base your work on the master branch. Create a new branch for your changes with `git branch feat/my_contribution master`, then switch to it with `git checkout feat/my_contribution`. It's best to avoid working directly on the master branch.
2. **Commit Logical Units**:
   - Add or update `stories` to demonstrate new features or properties.
   - Ensure your changes are compatible with existing `stories`.
3. **Commit Messages**: Follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for your commit messages and include the issue number.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your topic branch in your fork.
2. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit a PR to the main repository. Be sure to:
   - Write a clear PR title and description detailing what your changes do and why they're needed.
   - Link your PR to any relevant issues it addresses by following the [Conventional Commit ](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
