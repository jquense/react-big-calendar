# About Our Examples

We have attempted to provide best practice code examples for using Big Calendar.

Big Calendar is... well, "big". It has dozens of props, and can be configured in a lot of different ways to meet a wide number of use cases. It also has quite a number of subcomponents, and provides the ability to override most all of them.

Because of this, it's important to think about how you initialize your properties as you pass them to Big Calendar. Let's look at a small example:

```js
// don't do this
<Calendar defaultDate={new Date(2015, 3, 13)} {...otherProps} />
```

```js
// do this
const {defaultDate} = useMemo(() => ({
  defaultDate: new Date(2015, 3, 13)
}), [])
//...
<Calendar defaultDate={defaultDate} {...otherProps} />
```

Instantiating a new JS `Date` creates a new object. React will see this 'new' prop and re-render every subcomponent that relies upon `defaultDate`, even if (technically) it did not change.

```js
// don't do this
<Calendar onView={(newView) => setView(newView)} {...otherProps} />
```

```js
// and don't do this
const onView = (newView) => setView(newView)
<Calendar onView={onView} {...otherProps} />
```

```js
// do this
const onView = useCallback((newView) => setView(newView), [setView])
<Calendar onView={onView} {...otherProps} />
```

If a prop takes an `Object`, an `Array`, a `Date`, a `Function`, or any other non-simple variable type, it is always a good idea to memoize those values prior to passing them as props. Chances are that some prop or state change will trigger a re-render of your Calendar. How well you manage your props will effect overall render performance.
