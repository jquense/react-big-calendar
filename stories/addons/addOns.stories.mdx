# Addons

An "Addon" is some bit of code to enhance and expand the functionality of Big Calendar. These are typically provided by someone within the Big Calendar developer community.

In this section we document those Addons that we have included directly in the Big Calendar codebase. If you have additional Add-ons that you have created for Big Calendar please let us know and we may link it here in the documentation.
