# dragFromOutsideItem

- type: `function () => boolean`

A callback to get a temporary `event` to display in a slot in the process of dragging from outside. This is not required for Drag and Drop to function, but provides a nice visual cue to the user when dragging in an item from outside of the Calendar.

Tip: Toggle the checkbox, in the example, and drag an outside item in. Do this from both checkbox states to see the difference in effect.
