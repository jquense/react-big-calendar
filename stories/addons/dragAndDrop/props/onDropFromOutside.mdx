# onDropFromOutside

- type: `function ({ start, end, allDay }) => any`

A callback fired when user drops an item onto the Calendar from outside of the Calendar. Developers will typically use this method to add new items to the Calendar's <LinkTo kind="props" story="events">events</LinkTo>.

**Important:** The callback does **not** receive the element being dropped. It only receives the details of the slot an element was dropped on.
