# Custom Styling

Out of the box, you can include the compiled CSS files and be up and running. But, sometimes, you may want to style Big Calendar to match your application styling. For this reason, SASS files are included with Big Calendar. 

```sass
@import 'react-big-calendar/lib/sass/styles';
@import 'react-big-calendar/lib/addons/dragAndDrop/styles'; // if using DnD
```

SASS implementation provides a `variables` file containing color and sizing variables that you can update to fit your application. 

It is also possible to set css custom variables that will be evaluated in runtime. This can be useful if you can't or don't want to use SASS. These are usually named the same as the SASS variables with `--rbc-` prefixed (instead of `$`). You can set these in the `:root` selector or any other selector if you prefer, like this:

```css
:root {
    --rbc-event-bg: #c0ffee;
    --rbc-event-color: black;
    --rbc-btn-bg: #bada55;
    --rbc-btn-bg--active: #c0ff33;
}
```

Note: Changing and/or overriding styles can cause rendering issues with your Big Calendar. Carefully test each change accordingly.
