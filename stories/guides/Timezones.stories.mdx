# Dealing With Time Zones

Time Zones are... **hard**, and while changing the `culture` will help with internationalization and localization, it does not adjust the dates for a specific time zone. Javascript Date objects don't really support time zone switching natively, and date math gets **very** complicated. Thankfully Big Calendar does support `moment` as a localizer, so if you use [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) you can get your events to display relevant to a time zone other than the browser native.

To change your events to display as a specific time zone, you must [change moment's default timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/using-timezones/default-timezone/) for all dates, **using an IANA time zone**.

```jsx
import { Calendar, momentLocalizer } from 'react-big-calendar'
import moment from 'moment'
import 'moment-timezone' // or 'moment-timezone/builds/moment-timezone-with-data[-datarange].js'. See their docs

// Set the IANA time zone you want to use
moment.tz.setDefault('Europe/Paris')

// Setup the localizer by providing the moment Object
// to the correct localizer.
const localizer = momentLocalizer(moment) // or globalizeLocalizer

const MyCalendar = (props) => (
  <div className="myCustomHeight">
    <Calendar
      localizer={localizer}
      events={myEventsList}
      startAccessor="start"
      endAccessor="end"
    />
  </div>
)
```

The `momentLocalizer` will now handle all dates and date math as if the date is in the timezone you specified. It is important to note that [changing moment's default timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/using-timezones/default-timezone/) affects all dates, created by moment, from that point forward, so you may want to reset the default when your component unmounts. And, if switching timezones 'on-the-fly', you want to update your `localizer` and any Date based props (min, max, getNow, etc) at the same time.

**Note:** The new `luxonLocalizer` operates in a similar fashion. View the 'Luxon Localizer' demo and view it's source for an example of it's usage.
