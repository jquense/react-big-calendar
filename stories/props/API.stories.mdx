# All Props

### localizer

- type: `instanceOf(DateLocalizer)` **required**

The localizer used for formatting dates and times according to the `format` and `culture`

```js
// When using `Globalize`
import { globalizeLocalizer } from 'react-big-calendar'
import globalize from 'globalize'

const localizer = globalizeLocalizer(globalize)
```

```js
// When using `moment`
import { momentLocalizer } from 'react-big-calendar'
import moment from 'moment'
// and, for optional time zone support
import 'moment-timezone'

moment.tz.setDefault('America/Los_Angeles')
// end optional time zone support

const localizer = momentLocalizer(moment)
```

```js
// When using `Luxon`
import { luxonLocalizer } from 'react-big-calendar'
import { DateTime, Settings } from 'luxon'
// only use `Settings` if you require optional time zone support
Settings.defaultZone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
// end optional time zone support

// Luxon uses the Intl API, which currently does not contain `weekInfo`
// to determine which weekday is the start of the week by `culture`.
// The `luxonLocalizer` defaults this to Sunday, which differs from
// the Luxon default of Monday. The localizer requires this option
// to change the display, and the date math for determining the
// start of a week. Luxon uses non-zero based values for `weekday`.
const localizer = luxonLocalizer(DateTime, { firstDayOfWeek: 7 })
```

### getNow

- type: `function () => Date`
- default: `() => new Date()`

Determines the current date/time which is highlighted in the views.

The value affects which day is shaded and which time is shown as the current time. It also affects the date used by the Today button in the toolbar.

Providing a value here can be useful when you are implementing time zones using the `startAccessor` and `endAccessor` properties.

### defaultDate

- type: `instanceOf(Date)`
- default: `new Date()`

Sets the initial `date` value in your calendar when you don't want it to be 'today', when not using `getNow`, or controlling `date`.

### date

- type: `instanceOf(Date)`
- default: `new Date()`
- controlled by: `onNavigate`

The current date value of the calendar. Determines the visible view range.
If `date` is omitted then the result of `getNow` is used; otherwise the
current date is used.

This is a controllable prop, when using `onNavigate`

### onNavigate

- type: `function`
- controls: `date`
- example: `(newDate) => setDate(newDate)`

Callback fired when the `date` value changes. When included it is used to 'control' the `date` prop value.

### defaultView

- type: `string`
- default: `Views.MONTH (month|week|work_week|day|agenda)`

The initial `view` set for your calendar when you don't want it to be the default ('month') or controlling `view`.

### view

- type: `string`
- default: `Views.MONTH (month|week|work_week|day|agenda)`
- controlled by: `onView`

The current view value of the calendar. Determines the visible 'view'.
If `view` is omitted then it is defaulted to 'month'.

This is a controllable prop, when using `onView`

### onView

- type: 'function'
- controls: `view`
- example: `(newView) => setView(newView)`

Callback fired when the `view` value changes. When included it is used to 'control' the `view` prop value.

### events

- type: `arrayOf(Event)` **required**

An array of event objects to display on the calendar. Events objects
can be any shape, as long as the Calendar knows how to retrieve the
following details of the event:

- start time
- end time
- title
- whether its an "all day" event or not
- any resource the event may be related to

Each of these properties can be customized or generated dynamically by
setting the various "accessor" props. Without any configuration the default
event should look like:

```js
Event {
  title: string,
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
  allDay?: boolean
  resource?: any,
}
```

### backgroundEvents

- type: `arrayOf(BackgroundEvent)`
- default: `[]`

An array of background event objects to display on the calendar. Background
Events behave similarly to Events but are not factored into Event overlap logic,
allowing them to sit behind any Events that may occur during the same period.
Background Events objects can be any shape, as long as the Calendar knows how to
retrieve the following details of the event:

- start time
- end time

Each of these properties can be customized or generated dynamically by
setting the various "accessor" props. Without any configuration the default
event should look like:

```js
BackgroundEvent {
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
}
```

### titleAccessor

- type: `string | function (event: Object) => string`
- default: 'title'

Accessor for the event title, used to display event information. Should resolve to a `renderable` value.

### tooltipAccessor

- type: `string | function (event: Object) => string`
- default: 'title'

Accessor for the event tooltip, used to display event information. Should resolve to a `renderable` value. Removes the tooltip if null.

### startAccessor

- type: `string | function (event: Object) => Date`
- default: 'start'

The start date/time of the event. Must resolve to a JavaScript `Date` object.

### endAccessor

- type: `string | function (event: Object) => Date`
- default: 'end'

The end date/time of the event. Must resolve to a JavaScript `Date` object.

### allDayAccessor

- type: `string | function (event: Object) => boolean`
- default: 'allDay'

Determines whether the event should be considered an "all day" event and ignore time. Must resolve to a `boolean` value.

### resources

- type: `arrayOf(Resource)`

An array of resource objects that map events to a specific resource. Resource objects, like events, can be any shape or have any properties, but should be uniquly identifiable via the `resourceIdAccessor`, as well as a "title" or name as provided by the `resourceTitleAccessor` prop.

```js
Resource {
  id: string | number, // must be unique
  title: string
}
```

### resourceIdAccessor

- type: `string | function (resource: Object) => string | number // must be unique`

Provides a unique identifier for each resource in the `resources` array

### resourceTitleAccessor

- type: `string | function (resource: Object) => string`

Provides a human readable name for the resource object, used in headers.

### onDrillDown

- type: `function (date: Date) => // do something`

Callback fired when date header, or the truncated events links are clicked. When included, it will override the default drilldown behavior.
