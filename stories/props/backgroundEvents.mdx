# backgroundEvents

- type: `arrayOf(BackgroundEvent)`
- default: `[]`

An array of background event objects to display on the calendar. Background
Events behave similarly to Events but are not factored into Event overlap logic,
allowing them to sit behind any Events that may occur during the same period.
Background Events objects can be any shape, as long as the Calendar knows how to
retrieve the following details of the event:

- start time
- end time

Each of these properties can be customized or generated dynamically by
setting the various "accessor" props. Without any configuration the default
event should look like:

```js
BackgroundEvent {
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
}
```

<Story id="props--back-ground-events" />
