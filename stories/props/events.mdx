# events

- type: `arrayOf(Event)`
- default: `[]`

An array of event objects to display on the calendar. Events objects
can be any shape, as long as the Calendar knows how to retrieve the
following details of the event:

- start time
- end time
- title
- whether its an "all day" event or not
- any resource the event may be related to

Each of these properties can be customized or generated dynamically by
setting the various "accessor" props. Without any configuration the default
event should look like:

```js
Event {
  title: string,
  start: Date,
  end: Date,
  allDay?: boolean
  resource?: any,
}
```

<Story id="props--events" />
