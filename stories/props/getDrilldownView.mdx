# getDrilldownView

- type: `function (targetDate: Date, currentViewName: string, configuredViewNames: Views[]) => string|null`

Functionally equivalent to drilldownView, but accepts a function that can return a view name. It's useful for customizing the drill-down actions depending on the target date and triggering view.

Return null to disable drill-down actions.
