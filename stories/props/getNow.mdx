# getNow

- type: `function () => Date`
- default: `() => new Date()`

Determines the current date/time which is highlighted in the views.

The value affects which day is shaded and which time is shown as the current time. It also affects the date used by the Today button in the toolbar.

Providing a value here can be useful when you are implementing time zones using the `startAccessor` and `endAccessor` properties.
